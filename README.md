Framework
=========

A *very* simple (see also: unobtrusive) PHP framework. Mostly just a request router, SPL autoloader for namespaced classes, plugin loader/router, a very simple template engine (available seperately) and a config loader. What more do you need?

If you git submodule this framework (a sane way to do it) don't forget you may have to do a `git submodule update --init --recursive` to pull in the framework class, if you want to do it that way.
